# Substrate Node Template

This repo is copied from [substrate-node-template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template) and is exclusively used for completing easy tutorials for polkadot hackathon.

I have no intention to portray any original code is from myself, and all the original code will be shown in the first commit.

The changes to the code that I make will be shown in the following commits.
